# chef-repo

Welcome to your example Chef-Repo, <%= @login %>.

Now that you've installed everything, let's have a look around.

## Structure

### .gusteau.yml

A configuration file for all your environments and nodes. This project features one environment, `example` which only includes one node, `box`.

### Vagrantfile

A configuration file for Vagrant which includes gusteau as a plugin. It detects all your `.gusteau.yml` nodes with `vagrant` keys in them and configures Vagrant instances for them. The `example-box` node is one such example.

### cookbooks

By default, Gusteau uploads `site-cookbooks` and `cookbooks` directories when you converge a node. Between the two, `cookbooks` is a directory for your vendorized cookbooks. This example project uses Berkshelf, so in order to populate the directory run

```
berks install --path ./cookbooks
```

### site-cookbooks

Your repo-specific or work-in-progress cookbooks. A good place to store your [wrapper cookbooks](http://devopsanywhere.blogspot.com.au/2012/11/how-to-write-reusable-chef-cookbooks.html).

### data_bags

Chef Data bags. A way to store large pieces of domain-specifc configuration. See the included `users` data_bag for an example.

## Using gusteau

To try gusteau first with an example Vagrant node, bring it up:

```
vagrant up example-box
```

Then run `gusteau converge`:

```
gusteau converge example-box
```

## Testing your Chef-Repo

It is a very good practice to have integration tests for your Chef-powered infrastructure.
This project includes an example setup to get you started.

The tests are implemented using the excellent [serverspec](http://serverspec.org/) framework.

There are two important bits to have a look at:

### spec

The directory where integration tests are placed.

### `spec/spec_helper.rb`

Where serverspec is configured against your Gusteau nodes.

To run the tests:

```
bundle exec rake spec
```
