Gusteau is an easy to use configuration manager for Chef Solo and Vagrant. It aims to:

* Provide existing Chef Solo users with a more efficient workflow
* Make Chef Solo usable for a small to mid scale multi-node setup
* Make Chef Solo more accessible for the new users

Some of the features include:

* YAML for readable, flexible infrastructure configuration
* Usage of a single SSH connection to stream compressed files and commands
* Support for normal Chef CLI flags:
  * `-W` or `--why-run` (dry run mode)
  * `-l` for setting a log level and   `-F` for setting an output formatter
* Bootstrapping target systems with Chef-Omnibus or custom scripts.


## Getting started

Gusteau is a Ruby gem:

```
gem install gusteau
```

The following command generates an example Chef-repo:

```
gusteau init project-name
```

Make sure you read through `project-name/README.md` first.

A typical `.gusteau.yml` looks like this:

```
before:
  - bundle exec berks install --path ./cookbooks

environments:
  development:
    attributes:
      mysql:
        server_root_password: ASahiweqwqe2
      rvm:
        default_ruby: 1.9.3-p362
      users:
       - linguini

    run_list:
      - role[base]
      - recipe[mysql::server]
      - recipe[iptables]

    nodes:
      playground:
        host: 33.33.33.20
        password: omgsecret
```


## Converging a server

The following command will run the whole run_list on the node.

```
gusteau converge development-playground
```

Use the `--bootstrap` or `-b` flag to bootstrap chef-solo (e.g. during the first run).

## Applying individual recipes

You may choose to run a custom run_list instead of the full convergence.

```
gusteau apply development-playground "role[base],recipe[oh-my-zsh]"
```

## SSH

Gusteau provides a useful shortcut that you may use to ssh into a node. If you haven't got passwordless authentication set up, Gusteau will use `user` and `password` values from the node configuration.

```
gusteau ssh development-playground
```

Please note that `expect` utility must be installed for `gusteau ssh` to work.

If you prefer calling ssh directly, you will find the `gusteau ssh_config` subcommand useful:

```
gusteau ssh_config >> ~/.ssh/config
```

## Vagrant

Gusteau can save you from writing some Vagrantfile boilerplate code. It also enables you to move node-specific Vagrant configuration away from the Vagrantfile into node definitions.

```
nodes:
  www:
    vagrant:
      IP: 192.168.100.20
      cpus: 1
      memory: 512
      box_url: 'https://opscode-vm.s3.amazonaws.com/vagrant/opscode_ubuntu-12.04_provisionerless.box'
```

The following snippet configures Vagrant for all Gusteau nodes which have `vagrant` sections defined.

```ruby
Vagrant.configure('2') do |config|
  Gusteau::Vagrant.detect(config) do |setup|
    setup.prefix = 'loco'
    setup.defaults.box_url = 'http://example.com/vm/opscode_centos-6.4.box'
  end
end
```

* The `prefix` option lets you prepend your VirtualBox VMs names, e.g. `loco-nodename`.
* The `defaults` one lets you provide default values for `cpus`, `memory`, `box_url`, `box`.

Please note that the add-on only works with Vagrant ~> 1.2 and needs gusteau to be installed as a Vagrant plugin:

```
vagrant plugin install gusteau
```

## Configuration

### Before and after hooks

You can tell Gusteau to execute specific commands before and / or after `converge` or `apply` take place. They get executed on the host system. Example `.gusteau.yml` snippet:

```
before:
  - bundle exec librarian-chef install

after:
  - bundle exec rake spec
```

### Attributes
In addition to specifying `attributes` for environments you can set node-specifc ones. They will be deep-merged with environment ones:

```
environments:
  staging:
    attributes:
      hostname: staging
    nodes:
      one:
        attributes: { hostname: staging-one }
      two:
        attributes: { hostname: staging-two }
```

### Run lists

You can also override `run_list` for specific nodes.

### Bootstrap script

By default, Gusteau installs the [Omnibus Chef](http://www.opscode.com/chef/install/) 11.4.4. You can also set the Omnibus Chef version explicitly by specifying it in `.gusteau.yml`:

```
chef_version: 10.26.0
```

If you're targeting a non Omnibus-supported platform you might want to specify the `platform` value for a node: this invokes a specific [script](https://github.com/locomote/gusteau/tree/master/bootstrap).

Alternatively, you can specify a custom script in `.gusteau.yml`:

```
bootstrap: ./scripts/freebsd.sh
```

### Data Bags

Gusteau supports environment-specific data bags. To have `data_bags` for a specific environment, simply create a directory at `environment_data_bags/#{environment}` for it to be used as the `data_bags` directory

For example, if you ran `gusteau converge development-web` then Gusteau would first look for a directory named `environment_data_bags/development` and use that directory as the data_bags directory. In the absence of that directory, the `data_bags` directory is used as the source.

### Custom cookbooks path

By default, Gusteau uploads and sets Chef Solo up to use cookbooks from `./cookbooks` and `./site-cookbooks` directories. If it doesn't work for you, you can override these values in `.gusteau.yml`:

```
cookbooks_path: [ './my-cookbooks', '../something-else' ]
roles_path: './base-roles'
```
